	\subsection*{Exercise 19.15: show how to construct a send-constrained channel from a receive-constrained channel, and vice versa. Hint: use a trusted node connected to the given channel.}
	
	The following nomenclatures are used in the solution:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $c$: Any channel connecting the parties that to be able to communicate
		\item $h$: Hash
		\item $m$: Message
		\item $N$: Trusted node
		\item $t$: Time by $N$'s clock
		\item $rc$: Receive-constrained channel
		\item $sc$: Send-constrained channel
	\end{itemize}

	
	\subsubsection*{Construct a send-constrained channel from a receive-constrained channel}
	
	With the nomenclatures used, the problem can be rephrased as: given a $rc$, show how to construct a $s(rc)$.
	
	Use a $N$. When it receives a $m$, it uses the receive-constrained channel $rc$ to return to the sender a signed hash $\text{sig}\{h(m,t)\}$. Then construct $s(rc)$ from $c$ and $N$. 
	
	Assuming the receivers' and $N$'s clocks are synchronized, so the timestamp can be treated as current within a certain bound of the receiver's time.
	The followings are the steps on sending and receiving $m$ on  $s(rc)$:
	
	To send $m$ on $s(rc)$:
	
	\hspace{0.628in} send $m$ to $N$
	
	\hspace{0.628in} receive $< t$, $\text{sig}\{h(m,t)\}$ > from $N$ over $rc$
	
	\hspace{0.628in} send $< m, t$, $\text{sig}\{h(m,t)\}$ > on $c$.
	
	To receive $m$ on $s(rc)$:
	
	\hspace{0.628in} receive $< m, t$, $h > $ on $c$
	
	\hspace{0.628in} verify $h = \text{sig}\{h(m,t)\}$
	
	\hspace{0.628in} verify currency of $t$ and freshness of $h$
	
	\hspace{0.628in} Discard $m$ for verification fails, otherwise receive $m$.
	
	\subsubsection*{Construct a receive-constrained channel from a send-constrained channel}
	
	Using the same way, a receive-constrained channel can be implemented from a send-constrained channel. Again, the problem may be rephrased as: given a $sc$, show how to construct a $r(sc)$. Use a trusted node $N$ to receive and store all messages from any channels. Then the receivers use a send-constrained channel to reach $N$, and receive the next message from $N$.
